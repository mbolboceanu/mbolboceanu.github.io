## About me
I am a Crypto Researcher at [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/), Romania. I obtained both my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Mathematics from the University of Bucharest. 

My research interests range from studying hardness lattice problems to applications of lattices in cryptography, such as lattice-based homomorphic encryption schemes.
