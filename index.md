## About me
I am a Cryptography Researcher at [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/), Romania. I obtained both my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Mathematics from the University of Bucharest. 

I am interested in applications of lattices in cryptography, particularly in studying homomorphic encryption schemes and their security foundations, and more broadly, in computations on encrypted data.
